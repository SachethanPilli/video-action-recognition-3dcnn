# Human Action Recognition Using Deep Learning (I3D & 3D-CNN + LSTM)

This project explores deep learning architectures for **video-based human action recognition** using the UCF-11 dataset. Two approaches were implemented and compared:  
- **I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNet)** with LSTM  
- **3D CNN + LSTM** (custom architecture)  

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **UCF11 (Human Action Dataset)**
- 11 action categories including basketball shooting, biking, diving, etc.
- Each video is preprocessed to extract 16 frames resized to 224×224 resolution.

---

## Architectures

### 1. I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNet) + LSTM
- Based on pretrained **I3D ResNet-50** from `pytorchvideo`
- Inflates 2D kernels into 3D for spatiotemporal feature extraction
- Appended with:
  - LSTM for sequence modeling
  - Dense layers for classification
- Fine-tuned on UCF-11 dataset  
-  Pretrained on **Kinetics-400**

### 2. Custom 3D CNN + LSTM
- Three 3D convolutional layers with batch normalization & pooling
- TimeDistributed Flatten layer
- LSTM layer to capture motion patterns across time
- Dense + Dropout + Softmax for final classification

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Training/Validation Loss & Accuracy plots

---

## Libraries Used
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorchVideo

---

##  Results
- Both models achieved high performance on the UCF-11 dataset.
- **I3D + LSTM** showed stronger generalization due to pretrained weights.
- **3D CNN + LSTM** performed competitively with fewer parameters and more flexibility.
